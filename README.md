# Learnig C++

Wellcome to my Learn C++ repository. Here I will submit my learning C++ progress, this means everything about C++ and how it works and every learning project that I make while learning.

## Why I'm learning C++

I started learning Python a year ago and since then I've been coding in python as my main coding language and going from python to js for web development. After a long year of only coding in python I thought that since python runs C++ underneath it would be a really good idea if I started learning C++ to complement my Software developing skills.
